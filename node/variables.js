// there are 3 basic ways to declare variables in js

// Var, but don't use this one anymore
var test = 3;
var test = 3; // ok

// let, is like var, but block scoped, and not allowed to re-declare
let hello = 'world'; // Notice strings use single quotes
hello = 5; // changing the type of variable is okay, in this case string to number.
hello = [];
// let hello = 'world'; can't do this either!

// const is a constant
const iAmAConstant = 9;
// iAmAConstant = 10; can't do this!

// objects
// variables can also be objects
const obj = {}; // obj litteral

// objects can dynamically add and remove properties
obj.a = 9;
obj.b = 10;

// For Practice

// declare an object with an object as a property
